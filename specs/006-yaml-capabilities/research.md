# Research Log: YAML Capabilities Management

No specific research tasks were required for this feature.

The implementation will use:
-   **`PyYAML`**: The standard and most widely used library for parsing YAML in Python.
-   **`Pydantic`**: Already in use in the project, it will be leveraged to create validation schemas for the YAML structure, ensuring data integrity at application startup.

These are established and robust technologies, and their application to this problem is straightforward.
