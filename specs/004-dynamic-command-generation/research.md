# Research Log: Dynamic Command Generation

No specific research tasks were required for this feature. The implementation relies on extending the existing architecture and technology stack (FastAPI, Python, `bpy` API), which are well-understood within the context of this project.

The primary design decisions were derived directly from the feature specification and the principles outlined in the project constitution.
